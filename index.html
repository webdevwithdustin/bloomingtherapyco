                    <p>Our members are incredible women like you. Caring. Accomplished. Smart. Capable. But the cognitive, physical, and emotional challenges that come with aging can take a toll. In a culture that places a high premium on youth, amazing women, like you, can feel unseen and devalued. As a specialized mental health company, we understand the complexities of the aging process, and are passionate about helping you live your best life.</p>

                    <p>By living in the present moment with awareness, acceptance and compassion, we can fully embrace each moment without judgment. We can develop tools to help us respond to stress, uncertainty, and change. And we can align our actions with our core values, leading to personal fulfillment, purpose, and a richer human experience.</p>

To show off your creations, you will be invited to submit your art to our online art gallery, <strong>The Bloom Collective</strong>.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-3">Do you treat specific mental health diagnoses? </h2>
                <p>At Blooming Therapy Co., we are interested in your rich tapestry of life experiences. We do not focus solely on mental health diagnoses and symptoms. Many of our members do not require treatment for a specific mental health condition, but would like support with mindful aging. However, our therapists do specialize in addressing issues that disproportionately impact women over 70. Some examples are mood disorders (including post-menopausal mood changes), anxiety, substance use, grief and loss, and chronic pain.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Do you treat women with early or middle stage dementia? </h2>
                <p>Yes, we are well-suited for this. We do require family or caregiver involvement as well as member consent. </p>
